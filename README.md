# datascienceproject
An explorative look into advanced statistics within the NBA. Python was used within a Jupyter Notebook to analyze multiple data sets. We spent 50 hours on this project excluding the time we did work on our own. Group mates on this project with me are Andres Murillo and Matthew Harshany.
